# *Sexy* igit

Our implementation of an in-game item appraisal system

Description
-----------

*Sexy* igit interprets user items as comparable values,
providing access to a community database of virtual assets,
and serving key details on trading these assets

Layman's Description
--------------------

We securely connect you to Steam, find other players who
have items from your wishlist, and set you up for a trade,
protecting you from scams and dishonesty

**This app is for end-player use, not a library. Feel free to use this code as example for your own projects.**
